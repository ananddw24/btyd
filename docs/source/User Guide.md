# Quickstart

For the following examples, we'll use a dataset from an ecommerce provider to analyze their customers' repeat purchases. The examples below are using the `cdnow_customers.csv` located in the `datasets/` directory.

```python
from btyd.datasets import load_cdnow_summary
data = load_cdnow_summary(index_col=[0])

print(data.head())
"""
     frequency   recency      T
ID
1    2           30.43       38.86
2    1            1.71       38.86
3    0            0.00       38.86
4    0            0.00       38.86
5    0            0.00       38.86
"""
```

#### The shape of your data
For all models, the following nomenclature is used:

- `frequency` represents the number of *repeat* purchases the customer has made. This means that it's one less than the total number of purchases. This is actually slightly wrong. It's the count of time periods the customer had a purchase in. So if using days as units, then it's the count of days the customer had a purchase on.
- `T` represents the age of the customer in whatever time units chosen (weekly, in the above dataset). This is equal to the duration between a customer's first purchase and the end of the period under study.
- `recency` represents the age of the customer when they made their most recent purchases. This is equal to the duration between a customer's first purchase and their latest purchase. (Thus if they have made only 1 purchase, the recency is 0.)
- `monetary_value` represents the average value of a given customer's purchases. This is equal to the sum of all a customer's purchases divided by the total number of purchases. Note that the denominator here is different than the `frequency` described above.

If your data is not in the format (very common), there are utility functions in btyd to transform your data to look like this.

#### Basic Frequency/Recency analysis using the BG/NBD model

We'll use the **BG/NBD model** first. There are other models which we will explore in these docs, but this is the simplest to start with.

```python
from btyd import BetaGeoFitter

# similar API to scikit-learn.
bgm = BetaGeoFitter().fit(data)
print(bgm)
"""
<btyd.BetaGeoModel: Parameters {'alpha': 4.5, 'r': 0.2, 'a': 0.8, 'b': 2.4} estimated with 2357 customers.>
"""
```

After fitting, we have lots of nice methods and properties attached to the fitter object, like ``param_`` and ``summary``.

##### Visualizing our Frequency/Recency Matrix

Consider a customer who bought from you every day for three weeks straight, and we haven't heard from them in months. What are the chances they are still "alive"? Pretty small. On the other hand, a customer who historically buys from you once a quarter, and bought last quarter, is likely still alive. We can visualize this relationship using the **Frequency/Recency matrix**, which computes the expected number of transactions an artificial customer is to make in the next time period, given his or her recency (age at last purchase) and frequency (the number of repeat transactions he or she has made).

```
from btyd.plotting import plot_frequency_recency_matrix

plot_frequency_recency_matrix(bgm)
```

![rfm_matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColtAllen/btyd/docs/update_read_the_docs/docs/source/_static/rfmatrix.png)


We can see that if a customer has bought 25 times from you, and their latest purchase was when they were 35 weeks old (given the individual is 35 weeks old), then they are your best customer (bottom-right). Your coldest customers are those that are in the top-right corner: they bought a lot quickly, and we haven't seen them in weeks.

There's also that beautiful "tail" around (5,25). That represents the customer who buys infrequently, but we've seen him or her recently, so they *might* buy again - we're not sure if they are dead or just between purchases.

Another interesting matrix to look at is the probability of still being *alive*:

```python
from btyd.plotting import plot_probability_alive_matrix

plot_probability_alive_matrix(bgm)
```

![prob](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColtAllen/btyd/docs/update_read_the_docs/docs/source/_static/alivematrix.png)

##### Ranking customers from best to worst

Let's return to our customers and rank them from "highest expected purchases in the next period" to lowest. Models expose a method that will predict a customer's expected purchases in the next period using their history.

```python
t = 1
data['predicted_purchases'] = bgm.conditional_expected_number_of_purchases_up_to_time(t)
data.sort_values(by='predicted_purchases').tail(5)
"""
       frequency  recency      T        predicted_purchases
ID
509   18          35.14        35.86    0.424877
841   19          34.00        34.14    0.474738
1981  17          28.43        28.86    0.486526
157   29          37.71        38.00    0.662396
1516  26          30.86        31.00    0.710623
"""
```

Great! We can see that the customer who has made 26 purchases, and bought very recently from us, is probably going to buy again in the next period.

##### Assessing Model Fit

Ok, we can predict and we can visualize our customers' behaviour, but is our model correct? There are a few ways to assess the model's correctness. The first is to compare your data versus artificial data simulated with your fitted model's parameters.

```python
from btyd.plotting import plot_period_transactions
plot_period_transactions(bgm)
```

![model_fit_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColtAllen/btyd/docs/update_read_the_docs/docs/source/_static/plotperiodtrans.png)

We can see that our actual data and our simulated data line up well.

##### Example Using Transactional Datasets

Most often, the dataset you have at hand will be at the transaction level. btyd has some utility functions to transform that transactional data (one row per purchase) into summary data (a frequency, recency and age dataset).

```python
from btyd.datasets import load_transaction_data
from btyd.utils import summary_data_from_transaction_data

transaction_data = load_transaction_data()
print(transaction_data.head())
"""
                  date  id
0  2014-03-08 00:00:00   0
1  2014-05-21 00:00:00   1
2  2014-03-14 00:00:00   2
3  2014-04-09 00:00:00   2
4  2014-05-21 00:00:00   2
"""

summary = summary_data_from_transaction_data(transaction_data, 'id', 'date', observation_period_end='2014-12-31')

print(summary.head())
"""
frequency  recency      T
id
0         0.0      0.0  298.0
1         0.0      0.0  224.0
2         6.0    142.0  292.0
3         0.0      0.0  147.0
4         2.0      9.0  183.0
"""

bgm.fit(summary)
# <btyd.BetaGeoModel: Parameters {'alpha': 1.86, 'r': 0., 'a': 1.85, 'b': 3.18} estimated with 5000 customers.>
```


##### More Model Estimation

With transactional data, we can partition the dataset into a calibration period dataset and a holdout dataset. This is important as we want to test how our model performs on data not yet seen (think cross-validation in standard machine learning literature). btyd has a function to partition our dataset like this:

```python
from btyd.utils import calibration_and_holdout_data

summary_cal_holdout = calibration_and_holdout_data(transaction_data, 'id', 'date',
                                        calibration_period_end='2014-09-01',
                                        observation_period_end='2014-12-31' )
print(summary_cal_holdout.head())
"""
    frequency_cal  recency_cal  T_cal  frequency_holdout  duration_holdout
id
0             0.0          0.0  177.0                0.0               121
1             0.0          0.0  103.0                0.0               121
2             6.0        142.0  171.0                0.0               121
3             0.0          0.0   26.0                0.0               121
4             2.0          9.0   62.0                0.0               121
"""
```

With this dataset, we can perform model estimation on the `_cal` columns, and test on the `_holdout` columns:

```python
from btyd.plotting import plot_calibration_purchases_vs_holdout_purchases

bgm.fit(summary_cal_holdout)
plot_calibration_purchases_vs_holdout_purchases(bgf, summary_cal_holdout)
```

![holdout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColtAllen/btyd/docs/update_read_the_docs/docs/source/_static/holdout_graph.png)

##### Customer Predictions

Based on customer history, we can predict what an individual's future purchases might look like:

```python
t = 10 #predict purchases in 10 periods
individual = summary.iloc[20]
# The below function is an alias to `bfm.conditional_expected_number_of_purchases_up_to_time`
bgm.predict('cond_n_prchs_to_t', t, rfm_df = individual)
# 0.0576511
```

##### Customer Probability Histories

Given a customer's transaction history, we can calculate their historical probability of being alive according to
our trained model:

```python
from btyd.plotting import plot_history_alive

id = 35
days_since_birth = 200
sp_trans = transaction_data.loc[transaction_data['id'] == id]
plot_history_alive(bgm, days_since_birth, sp_trans, 'date')
```

![history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColtAllen/btyd/docs/update_read_the_docs/docs/source/_static/palive_history.png)

### Estimating Customer Lifetime Value using the Gamma-Gamma model

Until now we've focused mainly on transaction frequencies and probabilities, but to estimate economic value we can use the Gamma-Gamma model. First we create summary data
from transactional data also containing economic values for each transaction (i.e. profits or revenues).

```python
from btyd.datasets import load_cdnow_summary_data_with_monetary_value

summary_with_money_value = load_cdnow_summary_data_with_monetary_value()
summary_with_money_value.head()
returning_customers_summary = summary_with_money_value[summary_with_money_value['frequency']>0]

print(returning_customers_summary.head())
"""
             frequency  recency      T  monetary_value
customer_id
1                    2    30.43  38.86           22.35
2                    1     1.71  38.86           11.77
6                    7    29.43  38.86           73.74
7                    1     5.00  38.86           11.77
9                    2    35.71  38.86           25.55
"""
```

If computing the monetary value from your own data, note that it is the __mean__ of a given customer's value, not the __sum__.
`monetary_value` can be used to represent profit, or revenue, or any value as long as it is consistently calculated for each customer.

#### The Gamma-Gamma Model and the Independence Assumption
The Gamma-Gamma submodel relies upon the important assumption there is no
relationship between the monetary value and the purchase frequency. In practice we need to check whether
the Pearson correlation between the two vectors is less than 0.3 in order to use this model:

```python
returning_customers_summary[['monetary_value', 'frequency']].corr()
"""
                monetary_value  frequency
monetary_value        1.000000   0.113884
frequency             0.113884   1.000000
"""
```

Transaction frequencies and monetary values are uncorrelated; we can now train our Gamma-Gamma submodel and predict the conditional, expected average lifetime values of our customers:

```python
from btyd import GammaGammaModels

ggm = GammaGammaModel()
ggm.fit(returning_customers_summary)
print(ggm)
"""
<btyd.GammaGammaModel: Parameters {'p': 6.25, 'q': 3.74, 'v': 15.45} estimated with 946 customers.>
"""
```

We can now estimate the average transaction value:

```python
print(ggm.predict('cond_avg_profit').head(10))
"""
customer_id
1     24.658619
2     18.911489

7     18.911489
8     35.170981
9     27.282408
10    35.170981
dtype: float64
"""

print("Expected conditional average profit: %s, Average profit: %s" % (
    ggm.predict('cond_avg_profit').mean(),
    summary_with_money_value[summary_with_money_value['frequency']>0]['monetary_value'].mean()
))
"""
Expected conditional average profit: 35.2529588256, Average profit: 35.078551797
"""
```

And also compute the total Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) via the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow) while adjusting for cost of capital:

```python
# Refit the BG model to the summary_with_money_value dataset
bgm.fit(summary_with_money_value)

print(ggm.predict('clv',
    bgm, # the model used to predict the number of future transactions
    time=12, # time periods (in this case, months)
    discount_rate=0.01 # monthly discount rate ~ 12.7% annually
).head(10))
