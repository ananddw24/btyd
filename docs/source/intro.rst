READ FIRST: Project Status
--------------------------

BTYD is the successor to the `Lifetimes <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes>`__ library for implementing Buy Till You Die and Customer Lifetime Value statistical models in Python. All existing Lifetimes functionality is supported, and Bayesian `PyMC <https://github.com/pymc-devs>`__ model implementations are now in Beta.


Introduction
------------

BTYD can be used to analyze your users based on the following assumptions:

1. Users interact with you when they are active, or "alive"
2. Users under study may "die" or become inactive after some period of time

If this is too abstract, consider these applications:

 - Predicting how often a visitor will return to your website. (Alive = visiting. Die = decided the website wasn't for them)
 - Understanding how frequently a patient may return to a hospital. (Alive = visiting. Die = maybe the patient moved to a new city, or became deceased.)
 - Predicting individuals who have churned from an app using only their usage history. (Alive = logins. Die = removed the app)
 - Predicting repeat purchases from a customer. (Alive = actively purchasing. Die = became disinterested with your product)
 - Predicting the lifetime value of your customers


Installation
------------

::

   pip install btyd
